## Visualization

Real-time date from the tide buoy can be charted over a 24-hour cycle using this html script: [chart](https://oceanographyforeveryone.github.io/tidebuoy/chart) while the last 12 sensor readings can be recalled using this html script: [readings](https://oceanographyforeveryone.github.io/tidebuoy/readings.html). Barometric pressure is normalized against the most recent reading from the [NOAA Annapolis weather station](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8575512).  

## Correction factors for Tide Buoy currently deployed in Honeymoon Lagoon
