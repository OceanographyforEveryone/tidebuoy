We are in the process of updating the OpenCTD firmware to run on CircuitPython on the new RP 2040 Adalogger. 

Download a working library for the [MS5803-14Ba pressure sensor](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/main/Software/Firmware/OpenCTD_RP2040/MS5803-14BA) based on code adapted from [Sparkfun](https://github.com/sparkfun/MS5803-14BA_Breakout) and [Minyiky](https://github.com/minyiky/ms5803-micropython).
